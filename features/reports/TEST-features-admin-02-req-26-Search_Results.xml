Given I am logged in as "colmgr" in the group "cm"
And a collection with pid "dri:coll2" and title "Search Collection 2" created by "colmgr@colmgr.com"
And a Digital Object with pid "dri:obj2", title "Search Object 2" created by "user1@user1.com"
And the object with pid "dri:obj2" is in the collection with pid "dri:coll2"
