== Deployment

Once the test suite passes and the code base has been reviewed and agreed
upon, a branch is created for deployment, it should be dated in the form
YYYY-MM-DD the assets should be compiled and committed.

Once the assets are committed, a tag is created, this tag is then merged
to master for the the deployment scripts to deploy.
